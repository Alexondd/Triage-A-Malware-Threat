# Context for this project
You are an information security analyst in the Security Operations Centre. A common task and responsibility of information security analysts in the SOC is to respond to triage incoming threats and respond appropriately, by notifying the correct team depending on the severity of the threat. It’s important to be able to communicate the severity of the incident to the right person so that the organisation can come together in times of attack.

The firewall logs & list of infrastructure has been provided, which shows critical services that run the Spring Framework and need to be online / uninterrupted. A list of teams has also been provided, which depending on the severity of the threat, must be contacted.

It’s important to note that the service is down and functionality is impaired due to the malware attack.

Your task is to triage the current malware threat and figure out which infrastructure is affected.

First, find out which key infrastructure is currently under attack. Note the priority of the affected infrastructure to the company - this will determine who is the respective team to notify.

After, draft an email to the respective team alerting them of the current attack so that they can begin an incident response. Make sure to include the timestamp of when the incident occurred. Make it concise and contextual.

The purpose of this email is to ensure the respective team is aware of the ongoing incident and to be prepared for mitigation advice.

# How to Triage a Malware Threat and Identify Affected Infrastructure (Reference the Firewall_Infrastructure_List doc)
**1. Review Firewall Logs:**
- Look at the firewall logs to identify unusual or suspicious activities. These could include unauthorized access attempts, unexpected traffic, or known malicious patterns.
- In this case, multiple suspicious bypass actions were detected using POST requests to /tomcatwar.jsp.
  
**2. Identify Targeted Infrastructure:**
- Cross-reference the affected network hostnames or IP addresses in the logs with the list of infrastructure.
- Here, the suspicious activities were targeting 'nbn.external.network'.
  
**3. Determine the Impact:**
- Assess which services or functionalities are disrupted by this activity. If a service is down or performance is degraded, note it.
- The NBN Connection service was down, indicating a critical impact.
  
**4. Determine Priority and Contact the Right Team:**
- Refer to the infrastructure list to check the priority level of the affected service.
- Identify the team responsible for this infrastructure and their contact information.
- The NBN Connection service is a 'P1 - Critical' priority, managed by the NBN Team.
